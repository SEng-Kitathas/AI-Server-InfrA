- changed Python compile PASS; compact schema parse PASS; CRLF-aware diff check PASS

This checkpoint does not claim A-042 is Git-published. After the dedicated engineering commit and push, independently read back remote HEAD and supersede this checkpoint with the exact A-042 commit/tree.

## A-042 ENGINEERING PUBLICATION — 2026-09-07
- A-042 `PROJECT MUTATION OWNERSHIP / EXCLUSIVITY` is **ENGINEERING-PUBLISHED / REMOTE-VERIFIED**.
- Commit: `df5cdd2f687c7da0ea9ac0b1abecb23579ae599c`
- Tree: `8ac51e5177e5a4edde449310c4566bab064eac04`
- Subject: `Add project mutation ownership exclusivity`
- `origin/main` independently resolves exactly to `df5cdd2f687c7da0ea9ac0b1abecb23579ae599c`.
- Post-push worktree: clean / `main...origin/main`.
- Pre-publication qualification remains `345 collected / 344 passed / 0 failed / 1 conditional skip`, with focused A-042 cluster 71/71 PASS and Git handoff verifier 11/11 PASS.
- This publication does **not** live-promote the Desktop Runtime. `GIT_PUBLICATION != LIVE_RUNTIME_PROMOTION`.
- The non-PCMMAD OBE/Skills A-001 stale-contract candidate is now the next Runtime/OBE discriminator and must be re-derived against this published Runtime; donor qualification alone grants no Runtime authority.
- Final schema redesign remains LAST and untriggered; whole-runtime convergence plus explicit user `hells yeah, ready` remains required.

## A-001 RUNTIME CONTRACT CURRENTNESS — QUALIFIED CANDIDATE (2026-09-07)
- Source donor: non-PCMMAD OBE/Skills stale-contract candidate; donor archive remains evidence, not authority.
- Re-derived against published A-042 Runtime commit `df5cdd2f687c7da0ea9ac0b1abecb23579ae599c`.
- Native contract: optional `expected_contract_digest`; exact current `ToolSpec.contract_digest` is compared immediately after native tool resolution.
- Mismatch: `409 CAPABILITY_CONTRACT_STALE` before router/provider work, schema/protocol work, approval issuance/consumption, mutation fencing, or handler effect.
- Malformed assertion: `400 BAD_EXPECTED_CONTRACT_DIGEST`.
- Legacy callers may omit the assertion; OBE/MCP may require it after capability discovery.
- HTTP `/lab/dispatch` and per-step `/lab/batch` propagate the assertion.
- Compact schema exposes the optional 64-hex assertion for both single and batch dispatch; authority model remains `runtime-authority-envelope-v1`; 30 operations remain unchanged.
- Qualification: focused A-001 + approval/MCP/result/schema adjacency `49/49 PASS`; changed Python compile PASS; full suite `352 collected / 351 passed / 0 failed / 1 conditional skip`; CRLF-aware `git diff --check` PASS.
- Status: **QUALIFIED ENGINEERING CANDIDATE / GIT PUBLICATION PENDING**.
- OBE/Skills 11-Skill interface remains **UNFROZEN** pending dogfood against the promoted Runtime interface.
- Final schema redesign remains LAST and untriggered; this compact schema field addition is adapter parity, not final schema redesign.

## A-001 ENGINEERING PUBLICATION — 2026-09-07
- A-001 Runtime contract currentness binding is **ENGINEERING-PUBLISHED / REMOTE-VERIFIED**.
- Commit: `a552af9957b99361c3aebf91c7abc65775e0ce43`
- Tree: `e51be9f7fb2f1e125b19d30e9da0e5324b661e4c`
- Subject: `Bind dispatch to expected capability contract`
- `origin/main` independently resolves exactly to `a552af9957b99361c3aebf91c7abc65775e0ce43`.
- Post-push worktree: clean / `main...origin/main`.
- Final qualification: `352 collected / 351 passed / 0 failed / 1 conditional skip`; focused A-001+continuity 18/18 PASS; broader A-001 adjacency 49/49 PASS; compile/schema/diff checks PASS.
- Runtime truth now includes optional `expected_contract_digest` with `409 CAPABILITY_CONTRACT_STALE` before authority/provider/handler consequence on mismatch.
- Legacy omission remains compatible.
- This publication does not freeze the OBE/Skills 11-Skill interface; real dogfood against this promoted Runtime remains the next integration discriminator.
- Final schema redesign remains LAST and untriggered; whole-runtime convergence plus explicit user `hells yeah, ready` is still required.
- `GIT_PUBLICATION != LIVE_RUNTIME_PROMOTION`.
