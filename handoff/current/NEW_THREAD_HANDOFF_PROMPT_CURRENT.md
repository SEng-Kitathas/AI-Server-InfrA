Re-enter `PCMMAD_RECEIVER_LAB` from persisted project/worktree reality, not chat memory.

Mode: BUILD-COMMIT with RECOVERY/AUDIT readback.
Role: R5 Reality Pressure Engine + R1 publication auditor.

Fresh pre-publication Git authority: `main` local/remote `014dc68c954ab099c43118bd5072349fb93385d3`; last engineering A-041 `a97a00f67f3b79dbbe18e092d29b8971e588d4a2`.

A-042 is a QUALIFIED 23-file engineering candidate, inventory `e2dcb52475bf5869b6f3ebc4561955e27ef52669291bb7e06aa96ca196b2f31e`; full suite `345 collected / 344 passed / 0 failed / 1 conditional skip`; compile/schema/diff gates PASS. It is NOT engineering-published until a dedicated commit/push/remote readback exists, and Git publication is NOT live Runtime promotion.

Locked contracts: `SESSION_IDENTITY != FENCED_MUTATION_AUTHORITY`; `RuntimeAuthorityEnvelope` is invocation authority; no authority smuggling through capability payload; state lock != consequence lock.

The V30 OBE/Skills handoff came from a non-PCMMAD thread. Use `OBE_V30_HANDOFF_BUNDLE_2026-09-06.zip` only as donor bridge evidence; A-001 stale expected-contract binding is queued after A-042. Runtime owns durable currentness/authority; Skills compose.

Final schema redesign remains LAST and requires whole-runtime convergence plus explicit user `hells yeah, ready`. Do not start it from compact-schema parity work.

Next action: verify current 23-file hashes/tests are unchanged, refresh Git-contained handoff mirror, commit A-042 separately, push, remote-readback, then post-push continuity update.

## A-042 ENGINEERING PUBLICATION — 2026-09-07
- A-042 `PROJECT MUTATION OWNERSHIP / EXCLUSIVITY` is **ENGINEERING-PUBLISHED / REMOTE-VERIFIED**.
- Commit: `df5cdd2f687c7da0ea9ac0b1abecb23579ae599c`
- Tree: `8ac51e5177e5a4edde449310c4566bab064eac04`
- Subject: `Add project mutation ownership exclusivity`
- `origin/main` independently resolves exactly to `df5cdd2f687c7da0ea9ac0b1abecb23579ae599c`.
- Post-push worktree: clean / `main...origin/main`.
- Pre-publication qualification remains `345 collected / 344 passed / 0 failed / 1 conditional skip`, with focused A-042 cluster 71/71 PASS and Git handoff verifier 11/11 PASS.
- This publication does **not** live-promote the Desktop Runtime. `GIT_PUBLICATION != LIVE_RUNTIME_PROMOTION`.
- The non-PCMMAD OBE/Skills A-001 stale-contract candidate is now the next Runtime/OBE discriminator and must be re-derived against this published Runtime; donor qualification alone grants no Runtime authority.
- Final schema redesign remains LAST and untriggered; whole-runtime convergence plus explicit user `hells yeah, ready` remains required.

## A-001 RUNTIME CONTRACT CURRENTNESS — QUALIFIED CANDIDATE (2026-09-07)
- Source donor: non-PCMMAD OBE/Skills stale-contract candidate; donor archive remains evidence, not authority.
- Re-derived against published A-042 Runtime commit `df5cdd2f687c7da0ea9ac0b1abecb23579ae599c`.
- Native contract: optional `expected_contract_digest`; exact current `ToolSpec.contract_digest` is compared immediately after native tool resolution.
- Mismatch: `409 CAPABILITY_CONTRACT_STALE` before router/provider work, schema/protocol work, approval issuance/consumption, mutation fencing, or handler effect.
- Malformed assertion: `400 BAD_EXPECTED_CONTRACT_DIGEST`.
- Legacy callers may omit the assertion; OBE/MCP may require it after capability discovery.
- HTTP `/lab/dispatch` and per-step `/lab/batch` propagate the assertion.
- Compact schema exposes the optional 64-hex assertion for both single and batch dispatch; authority model remains `runtime-authority-envelope-v1`; 30 operations remain unchanged.
- Qualification: focused A-001 + approval/MCP/result/schema adjacency `49/49 PASS`; changed Python compile PASS; full suite `352 collected / 351 passed / 0 failed / 1 conditional skip`; CRLF-aware `git diff --check` PASS.
- Status: **QUALIFIED ENGINEERING CANDIDATE / GIT PUBLICATION PENDING**.
- OBE/Skills 11-Skill interface remains **UNFROZEN** pending dogfood against the promoted Runtime interface.
- Final schema redesign remains LAST and untriggered; this compact schema field addition is adapter parity, not final schema redesign.

## A-001 ENGINEERING PUBLICATION — 2026-09-07
- A-001 Runtime contract currentness binding is **ENGINEERING-PUBLISHED / REMOTE-VERIFIED**.
- Commit: `a552af9957b99361c3aebf91c7abc65775e0ce43`
- Tree: `e51be9f7fb2f1e125b19d30e9da0e5324b661e4c`
- Subject: `Bind dispatch to expected capability contract`
- `origin/main` independently resolves exactly to `a552af9957b99361c3aebf91c7abc65775e0ce43`.
- Post-push worktree: clean / `main...origin/main`.
- Final qualification: `352 collected / 351 passed / 0 failed / 1 conditional skip`; focused A-001+continuity 18/18 PASS; broader A-001 adjacency 49/49 PASS; compile/schema/diff checks PASS.
- Runtime truth now includes optional `expected_contract_digest` with `409 CAPABILITY_CONTRACT_STALE` before authority/provider/handler consequence on mismatch.
- Legacy omission remains compatible.
- This publication does not freeze the OBE/Skills 11-Skill interface; real dogfood against this promoted Runtime remains the next integration discriminator.
- Final schema redesign remains LAST and untriggered; whole-runtime convergence plus explicit user `hells yeah, ready` is still required.
- `GIT_PUBLICATION != LIVE_RUNTIME_PROMOTION`.

## A-001 POST-PUBLICATION RECOVERY MIRROR — 2026-09-07
- Current Git/remote `main`: recovery-only handoff commit `7618b0350c0266c70125d226baa9371bf3844a9d`; tree `c895f36a6c51110300a2353d9056aa7425564ad1`; subject `Refresh A-001 publication handoff`.
- Last engineering feature remains A-001 `a552af9957b99361c3aebf91c7abc65775e0ce43`; tree `e51be9f7fb2f1e125b19d30e9da0e5324b661e4c`; subject `Bind dispatch to expected capability contract`.
- `RECOVERY_HANDOFF_HEAD != ENGINEERING_FEATURE_HEAD`.
- `origin/main` independently resolves exactly to `7618b0350c0266c70125d226baa9371bf3844a9d`; post-push worktree is clean / `main...origin/main`.
- Recovery-only mirror carries the published A-001 contract/currentness truth and does not add Runtime behavior.
- Next engineering frontier follows Commander intent; OBE/Skills interface remains unfrozen; final schema remains LAST/untriggered.

## IDEMPOTENCY RAID — QUALIFIED CANDIDATE (2026-09-07)
- Status: **QUALIFIED ENGINEERING CANDIDATE / GIT PUBLICATION PENDING**.
- Candidate: 7 changed/new engineering files; inventory `1d81399d5f98e6e37481cb3070a5d987c340aab2c9bf067bf1efa600fa803efb`.
- Earned laws: `IDEMPOTENCY_INDEX != CONSEQUENCE_AUTHORITY`; `RETRY_SAFETY_REQUIRES_DURABLE_PRE_POST_CONSEQUENCE_WITNESS`; `UNPROVEN_EFFECTS_DEFAULT_TO_UNSAFE_RETRY`.
- Runtime registry: 107 tools = 31 `safe_repeat`, 73 `unsafe_retry`, one `keyed_replay_when_keyed`, one `state_bound_replay`, one `position_bound_replay`.
- Execution keyed replay now reserves authoritative job state before process consequence, persists STARTING before launch, heals missing auxiliary index from durable job records, and fails closed on key ambiguity/conflict.
- Legacy commit uses write-ahead PREPARED witness and consequence-state recovery; lost-response append recovery does not duplicate bytes.
- Qualification: hostile response-loss `12/12 PASS`; broader adjacency `96/96 PASS`; full suite `364 collected / 363 passed / 0 failed / 1 conditional skip`; changed Python compile PASS; CRLF-aware diff check PASS.
- Claim ceiling: this does **not** make every mutation idempotent; unearned effects remain `unsafe_retry`.
- Next server engineering frontier after publication: Windows Job Object resource envelope, then remaining cross-domain raids. Final schema remains LAST/untriggered.

## LIVE RUNTIME PROMOTION — COMPLETE (2026-09-07)
- Live Desktop Runtime is now promoted to Git/remote `main` `4163606459324feaa31252b3c2a6d58d73aaff46` / tree `4b2836e1add4d218748e45b929189d2d72ed839b` across the curated 70-file Runtime set; final parity `0 mismatches`.
- Rollback snapshot: `C:\Users\ancal\Desktop\PCMMAD_LIVE_ROLLBACKS\20260907_195134_pre_b8b6ca69`; archive SHA `0b4b59a8891899b402bee3aac36de553b432e4588098f7f4b90eadd4a81a01b2`; restore script present.
- Governed receiver+ngrok restart complete; final receipt request `db9d766b17044cddbeb57474e76518ca`, `stage=ready`, `ok=true`; receiver PIDs `8792/15256`; ngrok PID `41744`.
- Public async action is live-functional: `compatibility_no_lease` binding when no governed lease is active; final job `job-4fbdd90dd2f3` completed rc=0; identical same-key resubmission returned same job / `replayed=true`; `completion_journal_status=recorded`.
- Live health: Runtime online / 107 tools / scheduler+watcher active; aggregate degraded only by optional browser bridge unavailability.
- `LIVE_PROMOTION_COMPLETE != FINAL_SCHEMA_READY`; OBE/Skills interface remains unfrozen; next server engineering campaign is Windows Job Object resource envelope, then remaining raids; final schema LAST/untriggered.
